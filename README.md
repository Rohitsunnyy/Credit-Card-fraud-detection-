# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using credit card data. By employing various machine learning techniques, this repository aims to build a predictive model that can identify potentially fraudulent activities, thereby helping to enhance security measures and minimize financial losses.

## Objectives
- **Data Analysis:** Conduct thorough exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and patterns from the transaction data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Enhance model accuracy by engineering relevant features that can distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
- **Model Development:** Implement several machine learning models to identify the best performer for fraud detection.
- **Evaluation:** Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC-AUC score to evaluate model performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-Learn for building and evaluating machine learning models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Installation
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rohitsunnyy/Credit-Card-fraud-detection-
cd Credit-Card-fraud-detection-
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After installation, you can run the project by navigating to the source code directory and executing the main script:
```bash
python fraud_detection.py
```

## Data
The dataset used in this project involves transactions made by credit cards. It includes both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, and the goal is to correctly classify new transactions. Note: Due to privacy concerns, the actual data may be anonymized or transformed.
